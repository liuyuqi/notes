MySQL Pitfalls

1. Error 1005 cannot create table (errno: 150)

  A. From MySQL website: table creation failed because a foreign key constraint was not correctly formed. 
  B. Reasons can be:
     a. spelling mistake of colomn name of foreign fields;
     b. MySQL enforces ordering of columns when using foreign key... This is said to reduce query time. So we have to add index(foreign_key) to use that. e.g.
        (in the syntax of building new tables:)
        ......
        index (foreign_key_name),
        ......

        (out of building new tables:)
        alter table table_name add index (foreign_key_name);


2. Failure to delete foreign key constraints.
   a. Check the constraint name of the foreign key
       show create table table_name;
   b. Then delete the foreign key by the constraint name:
       alter table table_name drop foreign key prereq_ibfk_1;
