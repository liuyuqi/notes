========================
segmentation fault:
------------------------
1. Some pointers need to be initialized before being used in a function.
   Wrong: struct stat *stat_buf;
          fstat (fd_read, stat_buf);

   Correct: struct stat stat_buf;
            fstat (fd_read, &stat_buf);

2. Avoid referencing NULL pointers, which is very important! You might have initialized a pointer as NULL, and then get into trouble referencing it before assigning a value to it.

========================
make warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘exit’ [enabled by default]
------------------------
  Nothing to say, just remember to include <stdlib.h>. However it's fine if you don't include it, since the compiler will treat exit() function as built-in function and enabled it by default.

========================
make warning: ‘gets’ is deprecated  [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
------------------------
This is because there are better options than gets() that we’ll discuss later, and the compiler wants to discourage us from using gets() in general.

If the warnings bother you, add the -Wno-deprecated-declarations option to your gcc command.
